*Thornhill* is part of an experimental capability to use detailed compute and memory models together with [Ember](../ember/intro) motifs in network simulations. Thornhill provides an interface to a the [Miranda](../miranda/intro) CPU model and the coordination of the memory heap for a modeled node.
