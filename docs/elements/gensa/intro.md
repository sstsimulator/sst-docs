This element provides a general-purpose neuromorphic processor core. It performs standard leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) dynamics for simulated neurons, and exchanges spike messages between neurons. Currently, this core is standalone. An upcoming release will add the ability to connect cores via standard network elements.

This element has been interchangeably referred to as "gensa" and "GNA" in the past but the element has now been renamed to "gensa".
