The *cramSim* element implements a memory controller and memory models for DDR and HBM. The controller can either accept a trace file or can be connected to memHierarchy components to use within a larger simulation. More detailed information resides in a README in the cramSim source repository.

:::info

This element has been renamed from 'CramSim' to 'cramSim' in an effort to standardize library naming conventions in SST Elements (lowercase or camelcase). Input files from pre-SST 13.1 need to be updated accordingly.
