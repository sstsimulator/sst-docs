title: simpleSimulation
---

The *simpleSimulation* library consists of two examples that model the throughput of cars going through a carwash. `simpleCarWash` models the carwash in a single monolithic component. `distCarWash` separates the carwash operation into two components that interact with each other: a car generator (`distCarGenerator`)and a carwash (`distCarWash`). This element is provided as an example of discrete event simulation and the SST APIs.
