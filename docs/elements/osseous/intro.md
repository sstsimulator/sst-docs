*Osseous* is a generic RTL component template. It is a major part of the ERAS framework which leverages [ESSENT](https://github.com/ucsc-vama/essent) to automate the translation of a [FIRRTL](https://github.com/chipsalliance/firrtl) hardware description into a component compatible with simulation via SST.
