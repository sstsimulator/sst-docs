The *mercury* library enables simulating the behavior of large-scale applications. The elements are derived from functionality available in [macro](../macro/intro) and designed for use with the rest of the SST ecosystem. Mercury achieves accurate results by mimicking (skeletonizing) both the computation and network communication patterns of the application under test. Work is underway to automate this approach by leveraging compiler frameworks.
