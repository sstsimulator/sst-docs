title: ember
---

The *ember* library provides infrastructure for modeling network endpoints and generating network traffic for large-scale network simulations. Applications are modeled as motifs which generate network traffic. Both MPI-like and SHMEM-like motifs are supported. Ember integrates with Firefly which models the NIC and uses the Hermes interface. These in turn integrate with network simulators that implement the [SST:SimpleNetwork](../../core/iface/SimpleNetwork/class) interface.
