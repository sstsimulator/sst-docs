SST Element libraries contain components, subcomponents, modules, and other SST objects that can be used to build a simulation. 


## [SST Community Libraries](../community)
The pages in this area describe the libraries available from the SST project. Many other libraries are available, check out the [community page](../community).

## SST Project Libraries
Most SST-provided element libraries are located in the [sst-elements](https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-elements) repository, though a few are in separate repositories. 
The libraries range from early-stage models with limited functionality to those that are mature and extensively tested. In addition, we categorize elements by development activity and planned trajectory ("development path").

    <td> <i>Reliable.</i> The element's major features are stable, tested, and in some cases, validated. Major and/or breaking changes are communicated to users in advance (e.g., deprecation warnings, release notes, etc.). </td>
    <td> <i>Required.</i> Has undergone substantial capability testing. Builds reliably as part of overnight project builds. </td> 
    <td> <i>Required.</i> More extensive than that of prototype elements. </td>

  <TabItem value="develop" label="Development Path">

  In addition to a maturity level, elements belong to one of the following development paths.  &nbsp;  
  
  
  **Experimental:** A unique, "one-off" or experimental implementation that is not necessarily intended to be part of SST long-term. No elements in other development paths may rely on experimental elements. These elements are considered "unsupported".  &nbsp;  
  
  
  **Active:** An element that is actively being maintained, enhanced, and developed. &nbsp;  
  
  
  **Maintenance:** An element that is not currently under active development but is still maintained and tested regularly. Occasional feature updates and bug fixes will be made to ensure the element continues to function. This does *not* imply end-of-life. &nbsp;  
  
  
  **Deprecated:** An element that is end-of-life. Once deprecated, an element is subject to removal in future releases.

### `sst-info`
All Element libraries, whether provided via the SST repos or from the community, export certain Element Library Information (ELI) that can be queried at the command line using the `sst-info` utility.
This information includes a basic description of each element (i.e., component, subcomponent, module, etc.) within the library as well the parameters, statistics, and ports available for the element.
Elements that implement interfaces (e.g., subcomponents, modules, etc.) also declare which interface they implement.
The documentation here supplements sst-info's basic information and provides context, implementation details, and configuration hints. 

### SST-Elements Repository Structure
The root directory of [sst-elements](https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-elements) contains a number of subdirectories as well as a brief README, License, and contributor information. 
The element source code lies in the `sst-elements/src/sst/elements` subdirectory. 
Each library has its own directory in this location. 
Generally, it is the convention for libraries to include their set of tests in a `tests` subdirectory.

## SST Elements
Elements range from experimental to mature. 
Most of the elements below reside in the sst-elements repository, but a few are in standalone repositories. 
All are available via the sstsimulator repositories while only the "released" libraries are available from the release tarballs.

### Network Endpoints

These models are generally used to drive networks at system scales where detailed cycle-level processor modeling become prohibitively time-consuming.
